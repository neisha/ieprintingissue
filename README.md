Having an issue with scaling and printing in IE11

To view the issue in action, open the following link in IE11:

https://neisha.github.io/ieprintingissue/

Then right-click and open print preview. You will see that the content only takes up half the page, unlike how it is rendered in the browser where it is the full height.

I managed to find a partial workaround for this with the restriction it can only be one page's worth of content.
